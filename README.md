# 🔁 API Integrations

This repository includes API-first automation projects using **Postman** and **Python**. These workflows are designed to streamline telecom operations — including number porting, monitoring, and disaster recovery trigger automation.

---

## ✨ Overview

The projects here simulate real-world telecom API use cases using REST protocols, authentication flows, and dynamic payloads. They’re built to reflect scalable, testable workflows that can be integrated into enterprise service delivery platforms.
